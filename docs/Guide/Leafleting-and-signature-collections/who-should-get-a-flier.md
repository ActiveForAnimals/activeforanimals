## Who should get a flier?

The short answer is: everyone should get a flier! Some people are more likely to
become vegetarians or vegans. This applies for example to young women.  

On the other hand, vegetarians and vegans exist in all kinds of places in
society. When we do leafleting on the street, it is important to get to as many
as possible. Therefore you should hand everyone who passes you a flier.  

If more people walk by you at the same time, and you can't give a flier to all,
consider prioritizing young people over older people, and women over men.
Generally the most important thing to do is to give out to as many as possible.
Don't spent too much time analyzing who to give to, and instead just hand out as
much as possible.
