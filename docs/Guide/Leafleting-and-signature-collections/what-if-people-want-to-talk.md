## What if people want to talk?

Generally, leafleting is about handing out fliers, not talking with people. It
is important to give out as many leaflets as possible. Therefore you should try
to avoid talking with people, and instead focus on giving out fliers. People who
stop to talk usually agree strongly or disagree strongly with your message. It
is therefore not very likely that a conversation with them will matter much to
the animals. We need to focus on everyone else.  

It pays to talk to people who are just about to become vegetarian/vegan or want
to volunteer. Consider if the person just wants to chat or provoke. Are you
actually able to change the attitude of the person? Finally, ask yourself if the
conversation is productive enough to spent the time on, compared to giving out
fliers to others.
