## Data enrichment

You provide the basic data of your events, such as location and time and date.

However, Active for Animals uses this basic data to draw in additional data to
your event, such as weather information and demographics for the area your
event took place in.

This additional data can help you ask more complex questions, such as how much
it matters to your outreach effectiveness that it rains or that the area you
work in is heavily or sparse populated or richer or poorer than other areas of
your city.

To see the additional data, simply export your events from the Active for
Animals website.
