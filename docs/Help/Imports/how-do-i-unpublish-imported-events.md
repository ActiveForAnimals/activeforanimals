## How do I unpublish imported events?

1. First go to the import page.
1. Click on *Unpublish* to unpublish the import and all its events.

<figure>
  <img src="help-import-unpublish.png" alt="Click on 'Unpublish'."/>
  <figcaption>Unpublish your imported events.</figcaption>
</figure>

When you unpublish your import, all its events are unpublished.
