## What about the law and police?

Your own country laws will apply to leafleting events. Usually, in European
countries, you can hand out fliers without a permit, as long as you are standing
in public places and there are just a few of you. If you are standing on
private property and are asked to leave, you should always comply. If you are
standing on public property and are asked to leave, comply as far as the laws
of your country require you. If an officer instructs you, always comply to
their instructions. Be respectful and polite to police officers. It is better
for our cause to keep a friendly and respectful tone towards officers, and
doing so will also make them behave better towards us.
