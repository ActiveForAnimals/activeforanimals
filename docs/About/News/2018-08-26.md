Finer grained exports, improved filters and more...

### Exporting only what you want

Every event on the Active for Animals website contains a lot of data. Now you
can select just the data you want to export, making it easier to extract the
knowledge relevant to your campaign analysis. Simply go to the export page,
create a new export and select the data you need.

### Support for result types in filters
    
As requested, filters now support result types. This means that you can make
even finer slices of your events, filtering on result types such as leafleting
or any of your custom created result types.
As usual, filters can be used to export or visualize data.

### Other features in this release

- Create events from the 'My events' page.
- Added sources to third-party content.
