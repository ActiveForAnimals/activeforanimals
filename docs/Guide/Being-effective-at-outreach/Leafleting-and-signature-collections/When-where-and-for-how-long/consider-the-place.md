## Consider the place

The best places to leaflet are where there are many people on pedestrian streets
or in shopping areas. People are usually not very busy there, and they are on
foot.    
Another good place is in front of schools, before and after school hours.
Generally, young people are more acceptive of our message than older people, and
places with a lot of young people are usually the best. Other good places are
events with larger crowds such as concerts, performances and public marathons.
When you've found a good place, place yourself in a strategically good position.
If you place yourself in the middle of a square, it may be too easy for people
to avoid you.    
Instead, place yourself at the entrance to the square or in a choke point so it
will be difficult for people to pass you without being offered a flier. If you
are more than one, place yourselves with enough space between you that people
have to pass through you. This way, you can offer the most fliers to as many
people as possible.
