## How do I unpublish a group?

Only organization managers can publish and unpublish groups.

1. First go to your group page.
1. Click on *Unpublish* to unpublish the group.

<figure>
  <img src="help-group-unpublish.png" alt="Click on 'Unpublish'."/>
  <figcaption>Unpublish your group from the group page.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

If you want to publish the group again, go to the group page and
click on *Publish*.

When you unpublish a group, all its events, imports and exports are unpublished
as well.

When something is unpublished, it is only accessable to managers of the
organization it belongs to.
