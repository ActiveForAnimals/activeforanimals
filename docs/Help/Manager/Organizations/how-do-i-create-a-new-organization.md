## How do I create a new organization?

To create an organization, go to
[activeforanimals.com/create-organization](/create-organization?tour=1) and
follow the instructions.    

When you create an organization on the Active for Animals website, a default
group and a collection of default result types will be automatically added. This
will help you to get started quicker.  

To read more about groups, go [here](../../help/manager/groups).    
To read more about result types, go [here](../../help/manager/result-types).
