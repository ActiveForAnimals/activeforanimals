# Pay-per-view

In a pay-per-view event you pay your audience to watch a movie, typically about
the animal farming industry.

## How it happens
You set up one or more laptops on a table on a pedestrian street. People walking
by are offered to watch a short 4-minute video and be paid a small amount of
money afterwards. The amount of money is typically low, yet high enough to give
people reason to consider. The American animal rights organization, Mercy for
Animals, pays viewers one dollar ( about 0,8 euros ). When a person has watched
the movie, you talk with them about it and for example ask them to become a
member, go vegetarian/vegan or sign a petition.

## What you need
To get the best viewing experience in a noisy environment, use headphones for
each viewer. This puts a limit on how many viewers at a time you can show the
movie to, but it ensures that they are focused on the movie. It is recommended
to use laptops, tablets or other viewing equipment that makes it possible to
show the movie to multiple viewers. It can be a good idea to use headphone
splitters that enables two viewers to listen to one movie screening.    
You should bring a table for your display equipment and optionally chairs for
viewers to sit on while they watch. It is also a good idea to bring flyers to
hand out and sign-up sheets for petitions/e-mail lists or other activities that
you want people to engage in.

## Where to show movies
Pay-per-view events are typically carried out on pedestrian streets, but can
also be held at schools, outside malls or other public places where you can get
a permit. Generally you will want a place with high pedestrian traffic that also
has room enough for people to watch your movie.

## What to show
It is likely that your organization has a library of animal rights movies to
show at pay-per-view events. Generally, pay-per-view movies are about the animal
farming industry, but your message may vary. Remember that people are usually
too busy to watch through a long movie. A short movie a couple of minutes long
is best suited to the pay-per-view format. To see an example, click here to

## Who to show it to
Generally everyone should be given the chance to watch your movie. However, if
your movie contains violent images, you shouldn't show it to children. This
especially applies to pay-per-view events, because there is an implied business
transaction between you and the viewer. Because parents may not be comfortable
with strangers asking their children to do things for money, you should
generally seek the parents permission before showing the movie to a child, even
if it is non-violent.
