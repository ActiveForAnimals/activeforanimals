## Who to show it to

Generally everyone should be given the chance to watch your movie. However, if
your movie contains violent images, you shouldn't show it to children. This
especially applies to pay-per-view events, because there is an implied business
transaction between you and the viewer. Because parents may not be comfortable
with strangers asking their children to do things for money, you should
generally seek the parents permission before showing the movie to a child, even
if it is non-violent.
