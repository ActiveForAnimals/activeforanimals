## How do I remove a result type for a specific group?

To remove a result type from a specific group, you can edit the result type
and deselect the specific group that shouldn't have access to
the result type. If you have selected 'All groups', you have to instead select
those groups that you want to be able to access the result type. 

When you remove access to a result type for a specific group, existing results
of that type will be hidden in that group and it will not be possible to add
more results of that type.
