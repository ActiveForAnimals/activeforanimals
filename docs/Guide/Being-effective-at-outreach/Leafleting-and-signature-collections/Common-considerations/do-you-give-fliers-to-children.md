## Do you give fliers to children?

Generally you shouldn't give children a flier. Childen are usually not old
enough to understand the information, and parents can become angry if you give
fliers with violent and bloody images to their children. One issue is that
children often ask their parents for a flier, and if the child reaches out after
one, you should ask the parents permission to give it to their child. Teenagers
and children older than 12 years should always be given a flier. They are
within our primary target group and they are old enough to understand the
information and make up their own mind.
