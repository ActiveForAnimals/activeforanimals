### Tracking samples, sales and give-aways of food

other types of data that animal charities track when engaging with the public.
To include this in your result types, simply navigate to your organization page,
click 'Manage Results' and edit the result type you want to track food servings.

### Other features in this release

- Overview pages (such as the event overview) are now paged
- News archive added to the website
- System maintenance
