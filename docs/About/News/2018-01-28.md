Filters and charts.

### A new way to divide your events
Introducing Filters: With Filters you can search for the events across your
organization that match your needs. For example, you can create a Filter for
events held in a certain street, or events from 2015.
Go to your organization page and select 'Manage filters' to create new Filters.

To see your Filter in action, go to your organization page and click on "View
results". You can also export events that match the Filter.

In upcoming releases, Filters will be expanded to allow you to search for events
with a specific result type, variable proximity to a location, tags, event
templates, and much more.

### Other features in this release

- Experimental chart functionality
