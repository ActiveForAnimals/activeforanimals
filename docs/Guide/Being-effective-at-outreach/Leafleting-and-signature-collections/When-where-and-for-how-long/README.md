# When, where and for how long do you do street activism?

The obvious answer is as often as possible, in the most crowded places. Yet
there is reason for thought, since some places are better than others. As an
example, it may not be effective to stand in front of a train station, even if
it is crowded. This is because people leaving or entering a train station are
often busy. What time to leaflet is important too, since some periods of the day
are better than others.
