## How do I delete a result type?

To permanently delete a result type, navigate to the result type overview and
select "Delete".

Note that you can only delete result types that aren't in use. A result type is
in use if an event has a result of that type.

### How do I delete/remove a result type for a specific group?

To remove a result type from a specific group, you can edit the result type
and deselect 'All groups' or the specific group that shouldn't have access to
the result type. 

Existing results of that type will be hidden in that group and it will not be
possible to add more results of that type.
