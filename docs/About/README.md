# About

Active for Animals is a website that helps animal charities to quantify their
outreach campaigns.

The website offers workflow tools to standardize input across multiple local
groups and draws on third-party content to report on weather information,
demographics and other data to help organizations make informed choices towards
an effective outreach strategy.
