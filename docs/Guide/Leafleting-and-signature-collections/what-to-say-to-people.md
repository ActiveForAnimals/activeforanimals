## What to say to people?

There are many different things to say to people when leafleting. Some of the
most common ones are “Fliers against animal abuse”, “Stop animal abuse” or
simply “would you like a flier?”.  

It might be good idea to use positive words that make people more acceptive
towards the flier. For example, offer them “a free flier about animal welfare”.
Another way to improve your chances is to use words that relate to the situation
you are in. This keeps your attitude fresh and fun, and influences people
positively.  

If the weather is good, say for example “a sunshine flier against animal abuse”
or “a spring flier on animal welfare”.  

It's a good idea to change dialogue sometimes. That will keep you from sounding
too mechanical, and makes it more fun with constant change.  

Your choice of words depends on you, but it is important that people perceive
the flier in a positive light when they get it. It is not a good idea just to
say “animal abuse” because that word has negative connotations.  

It is also not a good idea to give the message of the flier before they've read
it by saying for example “go vegetarian/vegan”. This will make fewer people
accept the flier. Remember that it is the fliers task to convince people and
your task to hand out as many as possible.
