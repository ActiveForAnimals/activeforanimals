# Stuff to remember

Here are some things to remember when out leafleting that will make a great
difference in the leafleting event.

Even if some people claim that they don't care about others opinion, it is a
fact that our behavior is affected by the people around us. It is important to
keep this in mind when handing out fliers. When one person accepts a flier, the
likeliness that another person will take one too rises – and vice versa.    
When people accept a flier, it is important to offer the person behind them a
flier as well. Doing so will start a positive “snowballing” effect where a lot
of people will accept the flier in a row. On the other hand, you can end up in a
negative “snowballing” effect where a string of people will reject the flier
because the first one did. If more than five people in a row declines a flier,
it might be a good idea to step back for a moment and let some people pass
before you begin again. In this way, they won't be influenced negatively by the
people in front of them.

The fact that peoples behavior is influenced by people around them is also
important for another reason when you do leafleting.    
If people throw the flier away, others will be prone to do the same. The more
fliers are on the ground, the more people will throw their flier away. This can
lead to a bad situation where a lot of people will throw away the flier. It is a
problem in two-fold: partly because fewer people will read the flier and partly
because people will blame the leafleter for the “garbage” filling the streets.
This will make people even less likely to accept a flier, and may hinder the
success of future leafleting events in that place.    
It is therefore important to pick up fliers on the ground.    
Every time you see a flier on the ground, you should pick it up and throw it out
– or put it back into your pile if it is in good enough condition. People
usually don't throw away the flier right in front of the leafleter, so you might
have to walk up and down the street or place to see if there are fliers
elsewhere. When the leafleting event is finished, take a walk around the area to
make sure there are no left-over fliers on the ground.
