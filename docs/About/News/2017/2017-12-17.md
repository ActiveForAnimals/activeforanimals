Extended location information, better mail support and bug fixes.

### Feature spotlight: Extended location information

Today we introduce yet another third-party data source: location information.
When you type in an event address, the Active for Animals website automatically
adds country, state, city, postal code and even neighborhood information to the
event.

This allows you to sort your event data by whatever location granularity you
desire. For example, you can sort leafleting events by postal code, to see the
performance across different parts of a large city or a country.

### Other features in this release

- Better mail support has been implemented to improve e-mail delivery.
- Bug fix: A specific combination of group settings meant that wrong result
types could be added to events. This has now been fixed.
