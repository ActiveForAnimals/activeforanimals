Tag overview, auto-calculating event duration and bug fixes.

### Tag overview

As a manager you can now get an overview of the tags added as part of the event
results. Simply click on 'Manage tags' in the 'Operations' section of your
organization page. This overview gives you insight into the frequency and kinds
of tags that your organizers have used in their events. The tag overview is a
first step towards a drill-down tool for exploring event result tagging from a
managers point of view.
 
### Auto-calculating event duration

When adding results to an event, you no longer have to type in the amount of
time spent on the event. The difference between the event start and end date is
automatically added to the result. You can of course override this, as desired.

### Other features in this release

- You can now download your exported file directly from the export page
