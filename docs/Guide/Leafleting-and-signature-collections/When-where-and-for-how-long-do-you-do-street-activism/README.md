# When, where and for how long do you do street activism?

The obvious answer is as often as possible, in the most crowded places. Yet there is reason for thought, since some places are better than others. As an example, it may not be effective to stand in front of a train station, even if it is crowded. This is because people leaving or entering a train station are often busy. What time to leaflet is important too, since some periods of the day are better than others.

## <a name="consider-the-place"></a>Consider the place
The best places to leaflet are where there are many people on pedestrian streets or in shopping areas. People are usually not very busy there, and they are on foot.    
Another good place is in front of schools, before and after school hours. Generally, young people are more acceptive of our message than older people, and places with a lot of young people are usually the best. Other good places are events with larger crowds such as concerts, performances and public marathons. When you've found a good place, place yourself in a strategically good position. If you place yourself in the middle of a square, it may be too easy for people to avoid you.    
Instead, place yourself at the entrance to the square or in a choke point so it will be difficult for people to pass you without being offered a flier. If you are more than one, place yourselves with enough space between you that people have to pass through you. This way, you can offer the most fliers to as many people as possible.

## <a name="consider-the-time"></a>Consider the time
When leafleting, some time periods of the day are better than others. It's all about meeting as many people as possible. On work days, the best time is when people are going to work or when they are off work, typically between 7 to 10 and 15 to 18.    
You can also use the hours around lunch time to target people that are going out for food. In the weekend, saturday morning between 9 and 12 is typically a good time. On sunday stores may be closed, so it may be better to focus on parks or other places of social gatherings. Assuming of crouse, that the weather is acceptable.

## <a name="consider-the-weather"></a>Consider the weather
It is obviously not very effective to hand out fliers in pouring rain. People will only be busy getting out of the rain and fliers get wet and soggy.    
That being said, it doesn't have to be perfect sunshine for effective leafleting to happen. People are generally more acceptive when the weather is good, but you may live in a city or place where the weather isn't ideal most of the year. The important thing is to spread the message, and this can be done in many sorts of weather. If it isn't perfect outside, it will alter how we do our leafleting. If it is a light rain, then try to find a place with many people where you can also stay under cover. The same applies to wind. Strong winds make it difficult to hand out fliers, but a shelter or half-shelter can be a great help. If it is cold, remember to wear a lot of clothes.

## <a name="consider-the-duration"></a>Consider the duration
The longer you hand out fliers, the better. Yet you might risk burning out if you are out too long every time. Try to get a feel of how much time works for you.    
When you have been leafleting for some time, you get an idea of how long it is comfortable for you to be out. On average, 2 to 3 hours is a good length. One hour is too short when you also need to find a good place to stand, and include time for transportation to the place.    
It can also take a little while to warm up, and before you know it, an hour has passed. On the other hand, doing it for four hours can be too much and make you not want to do it another time. It may also be difficult to transport fliers to last four hours, as they can be quite heavy to carry. If there are more of you, it  is often easier to keep spirits high, so if you go leafleting with friends, you can do it for longer.
