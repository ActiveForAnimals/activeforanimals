## How do I unpublish an organization?

Only organization managers can publish and unpublish organizations.

1. First go to your organization page.
1. Click on *Unpublish* to unpublish the organization.

<figure>
  <img src="help-organization-unpublish.png" alt="Click on 'Unpublish'."/>
  <figcaption>Unpublish your organization from the organization page.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

If you want to publish the organization again, go to the organization page and
click on *Publish*.

When you unpublish an organization, all its groups, events, imports and exports
are unpublished as well.

When something is unpublished, it is only accessable to managers of the
organization it belongs to.
