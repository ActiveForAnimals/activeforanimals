## Follow the leader

Even if some people claim that they don't care about others opinion, it is a
fact that our behavior is affected by the people around us. It is important to
keep this in mind when handing out fliers. When one person accepts a flier, the
likeliness that another person will take one too rises – and vice versa.    
When people accept a flier, it is important to offer the person behind them a
flier as well. Doing so will start a positive “snowballing” effect where a lot
of people will accept the flier in a row. On the other hand, you can end up in a
negative “snowballing” effect where a string of people will reject the flier
because the first one did. If more than five people in a row declines a flier,
it might be a good idea to step back for a moment and let some people pass
before you begin again. In this way, they won't be influenced negatively by the
people in front of them.
