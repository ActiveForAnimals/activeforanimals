Better date handling, improved export format and event templates.

### Better date handling

An improved date handling means a quicker and simpler workflow. The date picker
now enforces a European/ISO-style date input. Also, the event end date
automatically corrects itself to always be after the start date.

### Other features in this release

- A human-friendly export header allows managers to easily understand the
exported data
- Event templates can now set a default date, time and location
- Added 'About' section to website
- Result types can now use 'All groups' option again
- Minor bugfixes
