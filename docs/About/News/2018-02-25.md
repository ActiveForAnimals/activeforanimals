Improvements to the manager workflow.

### Adding 'All groups' to result types

With this new feature, managers can add all groups to a result type. Now,
managers no longer have to keep the list of groups for each result type
up-to-date. Simply select the 'All groups' option and the result type will be
available to all new and existing groups.
 
### Major rewrite of the website

A rewrite of large parts of the website means quicker delivery time on features
in the future, more stable performance and less clutter in the user interface.
We have tested extensively and expect the website to perform as usual. If you
experience any technical issues, please let us know.
