## What do events do?

Each event created on the Active for Animals website contributes to the
statistical insight into your organizations outreach performance. This will
allow the organization to maximize the available resources and help as many
animals as possible, by doing the outreach that is most effective.  
When you create an event, you are contributing to this goal.
