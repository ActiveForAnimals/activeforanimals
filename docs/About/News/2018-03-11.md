Improvements to the manager workflow and new import features.

### Delete unused event templates and result types

Almost time for spring cleaning? Now managers can delete unused event templates
and result types. This helps you keep a tidy overview and allows for more
experimentation with content. Event templates that are used for events and
result types that are used by results cannot be deleted, as they are in use.
 
### iCalendar support

Organizers can now import from Facebook, Google Calendars and other websites
that offer iCalendar integration. This feature allows organizers to import
events from their Facebook group pages and marks an important improvement in the
organizer workflow: no longer do you have to create events in two places.

Expect further iCalendar features in the future, such as continuous import,
event filtering, preview and more.
