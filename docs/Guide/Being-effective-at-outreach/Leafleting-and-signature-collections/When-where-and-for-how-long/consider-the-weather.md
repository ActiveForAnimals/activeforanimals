## Consider the weather

It is obviously not very effective to hand out fliers in pouring rain. People
will only be busy getting out of the rain and fliers get wet and soggy.    
That being said, it doesn't have to be perfect sunshine for effective leafleting
to happen. People are generally more acceptive when the weather is good, but you
may live in a city or place where the weather isn't ideal most of the year. The
important thing is to spread the message, and this can be done in many sorts of
weather. If it isn't perfect outside, it will alter how we do our leafleting. If
it is a light rain, then try to find a place with many people where you can also
stay under cover. The same applies to wind. Strong winds make it difficult to
hand out fliers, but a shelter or half-shelter can be a great help. If it is
cold, remember to wear a lot of clothes.
