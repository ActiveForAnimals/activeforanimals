Export group events, filter on multiple event templates and more.

### Export group events

Now organizers can export their own events by going to the 'Manage exports' on
the group page. This allows each organizer to keep an overview of all their
events data and use it with spreadsheet and statistical software.

### Filter by multiple event templates

Recently, managers were introduced to the Filter tool - used for creating sets
of events that match whatever criteria the manager finds relevant. Now the tool
supports filtering by one or more event templates at the same time. This allows
managers to visualize and export events that matches any of their multiple
event templates.
 
### Other features in this release

- Added missing link to results on the group page
- Fixed the event and group pager on organization and group pages.
- Added first version of privacy policy and terms of service to the website.
- Minor bugfixes
