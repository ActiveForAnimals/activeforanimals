## Consider the duration

The longer you hand out fliers, the better. Yet you might risk burning out if
you are out too long every time. Try to get a feel of how much time works for
you.    
When you have been leafleting for some time, you get an idea of how long it is
comfortable for you to be out. On average, 2 to 3 hours is a good length. One
hour is too short when you also need to find a good place to stand, and include
time for transportation to the place.    
It can also take a little while to warm up, and before you know it, an hour has
passed. On the other hand, doing it for four hours can be too much and make you
not want to do it another time. It may also be difficult to transport fliers to
last four hours, as they can be quite heavy to carry. If there are more of you,
it  is often easier to keep spirits high, so if you go leafleting with friends,
you can do it for longer.
