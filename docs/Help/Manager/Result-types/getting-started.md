## Getting started

Result types allow you to register results to your events.  

You can always get an overview of the existing result types belonging to your
organizations by going to [activeforanimals.com/result-types](./result-types).
All organizations start with a collection of default result types that are
available to the default group.    

These default result types include *leafleting*, *signature collections* and
*paid views*.
