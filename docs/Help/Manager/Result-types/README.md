## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting started

Result types allow you to register results to your events.  

You can always get an overview of the existing result types belonging to your organizations by going to [activeforanimals.com/result-types](./result-types). All organizations start with a collection of default result types that are available to the default group.    

These default result types include *leafleting*, *signature collections* and *paid views*.

## <a name="adding-a-new-result-type"></a>Adding a new result type

To add a new result type, go to the result type overview page ([activeforanimals.com/result-types](./result-types?tour=1)) and click on *Create result type*.   
Follow the instructions to create a result type.

## <a name="result-data"></a>Result data

When creating a new result type, you can select one or more data types. Data types determine which kind of result can be stored using that result type.    

Example 1: Traditional outreach results    
You may want to track your outreach activities.    
For example, if you do leafleting, you might want to create a leafleting result type. You would type "leafleting" for the label and select "leaflets" as the data type.

Example 2: Result types with multiple data types.    
You may want to create a composite result type that tracks more than one kind of data.    
For example, if you do your outreach from a table booth and both give out leaflets and collect signatures, you might want to create a result type called "tabling" that tracks both leaflets and signatures.

## <a name="limiting-groups-to-specific-result-types"></a>Limiting groups to specific result types

You can limit access to your result type, in order to only allow specific groups to use it. This may be relevant, for example if your organization has multiple groups of which only some of them do leafleting.

## <a name="strategies"></a>Strategies

Result types allow you to try out multiple strategies for your outreach activities. For example, if your organization wants to do a trial run for a certain type of activism, you can create a result type that matches your activism, and limit one or more groups to that result type.
