## Result storage

Results, such as leaflets handed out or signatures received, are stored for
 each event. For larger organizations, it can sometimes prove a challenge to 
 have each local group report their results in the same way.

Active for Animals helps make it easier to ensure data consistency across local
 groups by offering a rigid input form for data. This allows the organization 
 manager to control how and what results are stored.

But Active for Animals goes further: the result model enforces consistency
 across organizations as well. This means that with time, the more
  organizations join and input their event and result data, the better we
   will all be informed on the efficiency on our collective outreach efforts.

Whether you are from organization A or B, you will be using the same basic
 metric for storing your event results. When the same metric or 'data type' is
 shared across organizations, it becomes easier to do inter-organizational
 comparison of result data. This means that you don't just contribute to the
 betterment of your own efficiency, but to the animal charity movement in
 general.
