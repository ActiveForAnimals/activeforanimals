Event templates, HTTPS and bugfixes.

### Feature spotlight: Event templates

You can now create event templates that specify a default title and description
for an event. Templates help your organizers get quickly started without having
to think about what to write in their events and can greatly reduce the time
spent creating similar events.

More features to the event template, such as setting a default time of day and
location, are planned for future releases.

### Other features in this release

- HTTPS is now enabled and always active, increasing your privacy and security
- Missing breadcrumb links for organizers fixed
