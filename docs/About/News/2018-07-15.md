Better workflow when adding results, new field for adding links to external
event pages and more.

### Linking to an external event page

It is now possible to link directly to your Facebook event page, Google
Calendar event or any other planning website where your event is also hosted.
To add a link to your external event page, simply navigate to the event, click
'Edit this page' and fill out the Link field on the right-hand side.

### Jump directly to your group on log-in

To help users quickly get to their organization or group, the website now
redirects you to the group you organize or the organization you manage. This
gives you quick access to the pages that are relevant for you, and decreases
time spent navigating.
 
### Other features in this release

- Added 'My events' page that gives a quick overview of the events you have
created.
- When adding results, your browser will automatically scroll up when the
result form closes.
- Third-party data of an event is now visible for organizers and managers of
the group. Simply go to the event page to see what third-party data exists.
- Results are now visible on the event page for organizers and managers of the
group. Simply go to the event page to see results.
- A new summary explaining the result and data model has been added to the
