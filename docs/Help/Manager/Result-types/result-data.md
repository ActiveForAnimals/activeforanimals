## Result data

When creating a new result type, you can select one or more data types. Data
types determine which kind of result can be stored using that result type.    

Example 1: Traditional outreach results    
You may want to track your outreach activities.    
For example, if you do leafleting, you might want to create a leafleting result
type. You would type "leafleting" for the label and select "leaflets" as the
data type.

Example 2: Result types with multiple data types.    
You may want to create a composite result type that tracks more than one kind of
data.    
For example, if you do your outreach from a table booth and both give out
leaflets and collect signatures, you might want to create a result type called
"tabling" that tracks both leaflets and signatures.
