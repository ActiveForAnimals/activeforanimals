## What is a group?

A group is a subdivision of your organization. Groups (sometimes called teams,
local activist groups, outreach groups, chapters, etc.) perform the actual
outreach work. Large organizations typically have a leafleting group in one or
more cities.

create and access any event hosted by the group.

## Groups and result types

You can limit which result types are available to a group. This allows you to
for example create one group solely for leafleting, and another just for
fundraising.
