When you are out leafleting, your attitude is important. If you come off as
negative or unapproachable, people will avoid you. Even if they accept a flier,
the chance of them reading it is low.  

How you greet people is important for how many accept your flier, and how many
actually reads it. It is therefore important to smile and be friendly. Be the
highlight of their day, rather than an annoying hindrance.  

If you make peoples day just a little bit brighter, you increase the chance of
them reading the flier and they will have a positive attitude towards “people
like us” in future encounters. An old saying goes “smile to the world, and the
world smiles back”. This really applies to leafleting. A huge smile is usually
rewarded, and it makes leafleting much more fun. Even if people are stressed or
annoyed, a positive attitude will keep your own spirits high. If you are
energetic and have an upbeat attitude, more people will accept your flier and
the chance of them reading it is increased.
