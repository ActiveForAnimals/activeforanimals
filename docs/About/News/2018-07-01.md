Repeating events.

### Repeating events

Organizers can now repeat existing events, making it easy to create repeating
events every weekday, week, month or year. To try it out, simply navigate to an
upcoming event you want to repeat and click on 'Repeat this event' in the
'Operations' links on the right.
