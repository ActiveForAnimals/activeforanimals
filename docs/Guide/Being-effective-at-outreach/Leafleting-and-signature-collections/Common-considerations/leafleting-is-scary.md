## Leafleting is scary!

It is completely normal to be intimidated by leafleting in the beginning. The
first time on the street will almost always be a little awkward. It is important
to note that this feeling goes away when you have been on the street a couple
of times. It's all about getting used to it, and not letting yourself be scared
of trying. You quickly learn that a friendly and smiling demeanor will make
every leafleting event a positive experience for you. People usually smiles
back, and most are friendly.
