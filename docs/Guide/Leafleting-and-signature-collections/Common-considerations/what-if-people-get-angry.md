## What if people get angry?

People rarely get angry at you for leafleting. If you are friendly and smiling,
very few people are provoked by being offered a flier. Should it happen, it is
important to stay positive. It is quite alright to inform them that you don't
want to discuss with them and wish them a good day. Usually people will be
surprised if their rudeness is met with politeness, and that usually hampers
their aggression. It is also important to be polite in order not to become
negative yourself. You are far more effective when you are happy and smiling,
and if you reply to rudeness with politeness it is far easier to remain in a
good mood. If you engage in negative discussions, nobody wins. The chance of
convincing an angry person is very small, and negative discussions rarely help
the mood.
