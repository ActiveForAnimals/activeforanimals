Virtual Reality views have now been added to the growing list of metrics that
help you measure your outreach. With this new data type, managers can create
result types that track Virtual Reality views specifically. To use it, simply
go to your organization page, select 'Manage result types' and create a new
result type or add 'VR views' to an existing one.

### Upload your event photos

Now organizers can share their successes with pictures from their outreach
events. With this release, photos are shared on the event page. To add photos
to your event, simply edit it, and click on 'Photos' in the right side. Future
updates will allow for videos as well as sharing across the organization pages.

### Other features in this release

- Third-party content is added a day after an event has ended to increase
accuracy.
- Third-party content is now reset if the event changes address or date.
- Result types now explain if they cannot be deleted.
- Charts now include 'weekly', 'quarterly' and 'monthly' options when
visualizing.
- Improved event maps that allow zooming, moving, etc. instead of being a
static image.
