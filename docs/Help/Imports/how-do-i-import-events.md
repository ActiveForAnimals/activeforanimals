### iCalendar

#### Importing events from Google Calendar

1. Log in to an account that has access to the calendar.
1. On the left, locate the calendar you want to import from.
1. Click on the vertical triple dot icon next to the calendar name and select
"Settings and sharing".
1. Click on "Integrate calendar" in the left menu.
1. Select and copy the "Public address in iCal format". It should look something
like this:  
`https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/fwefwg43gewgwef32rf23%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics`
1. Paste the link into the URL field.

#### Importing events from Facebook

Note: Facebook does not offer iCalendar support for group pages. To import
events from a Facebook group page, you can create a Facebook profile and invite
that profile to any events from your group page that you want to import.<br/>

1. Log in to the profile you want to import events from.
1. Go to https://www.facebook.com/events/.
1. On the right side, locate the "Upcoming events" link and right-click it.
1. Click "Copy link location" or "Copy link address".
1. Paste the link into the URL field. It should look something this:  
`webcal://www.facebook.com/ical/u.php?uid=100001565486451&key=fewWQERr32f-hRr2`
