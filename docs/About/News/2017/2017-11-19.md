Offering yet another 3rd-party data source, Active for Animals now automatically
enriches your events with demographical data. The website uses the ArcGIS/Esri
system for providing location-specific data about population, households and
population gender distribution. It has international coverage and works by
aggregating data from within a 1 km radius of your event. As usual, you can
examine all data related to your events by exporting them.

This new feature allows you to relate your outreach effectiveness to
demographical data and can give fresh insight into what it takes to make your
campaign a success.

### Other features in this release

- A reworked help section offers more informative and complete help on using
the website.
- Preliminary work on data visualization, including user stories.
