## How do I edit an event?

All events belong to both an organization and group.

1. First go to the organization or group page that the event belongs to.
1. Find the event in the *Events* overview.
1. Click on *More information* for the event you want to edit.
1. Click on *Edit this page* for the event you want to edit.
1. Edit your event and save when you are done.

If you cannot edit the event, you do not have permission. Please contact the
organization that the event belongs to, and ask for access.
