You set up one or more laptops on a table on a pedestrian street. People walking
by are offered to watch a short 4-minute video and be paid a small amount of
money afterwards. The amount of money is typically low, yet high enough to give
people reason to consider. The American animal rights organization, Mercy for
Animals, pays viewers one dollar ( about 0,8 euros ). When a person has watched
the movie, you talk with them about it and for example ask them to become a
member, go vegetarian/vegan or sign a petition.
