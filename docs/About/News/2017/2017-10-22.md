Updates a little later and with fewer features than planned,
due to unforeseen technical difficulties. Remaining features are pushed to next
release.

### Feature spotlight: Exporting your data

You can now export your group events and all their related data, including
results, tags and 3rd party content such as weather information. At the moment,
CSV files (Excel-compatible spreadsheets) are offered. More export formats are
planned in future releases.

The broader plan for the import/export functionality is to serve as a funnel
between, and data sanitizer for, your outreach results and your statistical
analysis. With the export functionality, we are inching closer to this plan.
Additional export formats are on the roadmap, enabling integration with
statistical tools such as SPSS and Tableau.
