## Body language is important

How you move is also important to a leafleter. It is important to be visible on
the street.  

Keep in motion and make sure people notice you. Hand out fliers with your arm
outstreched and look people in the eye. The more visible you are, the greater
chance they will take your flier.  

Don't be afraid of standing in the way. Of course you shouldn't stop them from
passing you, but it can be a good strategy to stand in their path so they have
to walk around you â€“ doing so, of course, with a smile. Leafleting is more fun
if you use your body. Many leafleters stay in motion while leafleting. It keeps
the body going and improves your mood, and it guarantees that people notice you.
This increases the chance that they will take a flier.
