Group result charts, event template filtering, better event overviews and
various fixes.

### Group result charts

With this new feature, organizers can keep up with their own progression using
the built-in chart tool, by going to their group page and clicking 'View
results'.
As usual, managers can view all results across the organization by going to the
organization page and clicking 'View results'.
 
### Filter by event template
For organizations that use event templates to create events, you can now filter
your data by those event templates. This gives you even finer grained control
when exporting and visualizing your data.

### Other features in this release

- Event overviews now show latest events
- An event overview page has been added to organizations
- Number of events per organization/group page has been increased
- Minor bugfixes
