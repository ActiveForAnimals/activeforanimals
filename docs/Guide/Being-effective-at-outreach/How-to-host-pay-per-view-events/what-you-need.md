## What you need

To get the best viewing experience in a noisy environment, use headphones for
each viewer. This puts a limit on how many viewers at a time you can show the
movie to, but it ensures that they are focused on the movie. It is recommended
to use laptops, tablets or other viewing equipment that makes it possible to
show the movie to multiple viewers. It can be a good idea to use headphone
splitters that enables two viewers to listen to one movie screening.    
You should bring a table for your display equipment and optionally chairs for
viewers to sit on while they watch. It is also a good idea to bring flyers to
hand out and sign-up sheets for petitions/e-mail lists or other activities that
you want people to engage in.
