## What if I don't know the answer?

Sometimes people ask us questions that we can't answer. There is no shame in
being unable to answer. Admit that you can't answer the question, and perhaps
ask them for their e-mail address so you can check and write them back. Usually
it will be enough however to ask people to read the flier. Remember that we try
to avoid talking too much with people when leafleting. You can always tell
people that you are too busy handing out fliers. Tell them that the flier
contains the information necessary, and that their question probably will be
answered by reading it.
