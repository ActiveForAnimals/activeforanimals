# How does my job fit in?

There are two user roles on the Active for Animals website: *Managers* and
*Organizers*. Which role you belong to depends on the kind of work you do at
your organizaiton.

# The manager

If your work involves coordinating with many local groups or teams, setting
strategies for each group and planning on a larger scale, you would typically
take the role of the manager on the website.

As a manager you have full access to all pages belonging to your organization,
you can create new groups and events, import and export events, and control
which groups can add which result types.

# The organizer

If your work involves coordinating with volunteers or participants, arranging
events and taking care of the practicalities, you would typically take the
role of the organizer on the website.

As an organizer you have access to create events and add results to them.
You can also import and export events.

If your organization is small, you would typically have few people filling in
most roles. As such, you may have no need for the organizer role, as the manager
can do everything the organizer can.
