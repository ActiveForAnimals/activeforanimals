## Fliers on the ground

The fact that peoples behavior is influenced by people around them is also
important for another reason when you do leafleting.    
If people throw the flier away, others will be prone to do the same. The more
fliers are on the ground, the more people will throw their flier away. This can
lead to a bad situation where a lot of people will throw away the flier. It is a
problem in two-fold: partly because fewer people will read the flier and partly
because people will blame the leafleter for the “garbage” filling the streets.
This will make people even less likely to accept a flier, and may hinder the
success of future leafleting events in that place.    
It is therefore important to pick up fliers on the ground.    
Every time you see a flier on the ground, you should pick it up and throw it out
– or put it back into your pile if it is in good enough condition. People
usually don't throw away the flier right in front of the leafleter, so you might
have to walk up and down the street or place to see if there are fliers
elsewhere. When the leafleting event is finished, take a walk around the area to
make sure there are no left-over fliers on the ground.
