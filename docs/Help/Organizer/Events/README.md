# Events

On the Active for Animals website, event pages contain basic information about
an event, such as start and end dates and times, address, a description and
event title. As organizer you would typically create an event page for each
event you organize. After the event has concluded, you can then add results to
the event. Event pages can have any available result type added to it, be it a
leafleting result, signatures or something else.
