## Workflow tools

Using the ‘Result types’ tool of the website, organizations can control exactly
which metrics they want to track for a certain type of activity. For example,
you may want one or more local groups to track signatures, income and expenses
every time they are out campaigning.

With Active for Animals you can easily control who can add data, and what data
they can add.
