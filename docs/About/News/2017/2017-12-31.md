This year has propelled Active for Animals forward by huge steps, from going public beta, enriching events with third-party content, such as demographics, adding new result types, such as income and spending, and implementing spreadsheet exports of all your data.

It is now time to move to the next phase.

The theme of the first quarter of 2018 will be data visualization, using all the event information we have gathered to give you visual feedback on your outreach performance.
But visualization is just the first step on the 2018 road map. The two big upcoming themes are

- Gamification, giving users incentive to add results and making it fun to use the Active for Animals website.
- A prediction engine, helping your organization plan and strategize using prediction and projections based on your existing event data.

Thank you all for using the website, giving feedback, showing interest and generally supporting the effort.
We wish you all a happy new 2018 and look forward to continue working with you.

### Features in this release

- You can now export all your organization events with a single press of a button.
- Fixed bug so exports now add multiple types of third-party content per event.
- Various small fixes to the export feature.
