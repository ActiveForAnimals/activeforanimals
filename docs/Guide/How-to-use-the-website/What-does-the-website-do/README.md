# What does the website do?

The main task of the Active for Animals website is to collect data on outreach
work such as leafleting, pay-per-view events and fundraising. The data is then
processed and enriched before being offered to you as spreadsheets, charts and
maps. This empowers you to take more effective decisions in shaping the future
strategy of your outreach campaigns.
