# How to run a campaign effectively

As a friend of animals, you want to make the biggest positive impact possible
for them. But a fierce determination and love for animals is not always enough
to forward your cause as much as you can.

In order for you to become more effective at doing outreach, you must
continuously improve your methods.

An effective outreach campaigner follows a circle of testing **ideas** by
planning and doing **outreach**, collect and measure **data** and learning from
that data to test new and better ideas.

Doing this will make your efforts more impactful and better fulfill the goals
that you have set for your outreach campaign.
