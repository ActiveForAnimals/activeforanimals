Introducing 'City Pulse', a measure of the mood and stability of the places
where you do your outreach. GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language and
Tone) is a database that analyzes online news articles to extract tone and
political stability of a certain area and point in time. Using this
information, Active for Animals can help you understand your successes and
failures by giving you insight into the current 'pulse' of the city you are
working in. It works by asking the GDELT database for the average Goldenstein
scale and average tone of articles (positive/negative) within a one-week window
of time, and inside a 5 km range of your event.

This is the first step towards a fuller understanding of the activity within
your city. It may for example explain mood and receptiveness of the people you
are trying to reach and give insight into why some places experience increased
foot traffic while others don't.

Future expansion of the 'city pulse' are planned to include awareness of large
events and happenings within your city - yet another aid in your understanding
of what makes your campaign a success.
