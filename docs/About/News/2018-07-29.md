New metric for e-mail addresses collected, initial map support, descriptive
result fields and more.

### Tracking e-mail addresses

The latest metric added to the website allows organizers to track the number of
e-mail addresses collected at an event.
To include this in your result types, simply navigate to your organization
page, click 'Manage Results' and edit the result type you want to track e-mail
addresses.

### Initial map support

On the group overview page of your organization you can now see a map of all
the groups that have an address. This gives you a quick way to navigate across
your organization and marks the first step towards data visualization using
maps and heat maps.
To use the group overview map, go to your group page and add an address. It
will then appear in the map on the group overview page.
 
### Other features in this release

- Managers can now delete events permanently. To delete an event, go to the
event page and click 'Permanently delete this event'.
- Results now have descriptions to them in the event form, making it easier for
organizers to understand the scope of a specific metric. For example, it is now
explicitly stated that the leaflets result measures the 'take-rate' or 'number
of leaflets accepted'.
