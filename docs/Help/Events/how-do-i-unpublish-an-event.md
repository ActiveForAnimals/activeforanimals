## How do I unpublish an event?

Only organization managers can publish and unpublish events.

1. First go to the organization or group page that the event belongs to.
1. Find the event in the *Events* overview.
1. Click on *More information* for the event you want to unpublish.
1. Click on *Unpublish* to unpublish the event.

If you want to publish the event again, go to the event page and click on
*Publish*.

Events are unpublished when their organization or group is unpublished. Imported
events can be unpublished if the import is unpublished.

When an event is unpublished, it is only accessable to managers of the
organization.
