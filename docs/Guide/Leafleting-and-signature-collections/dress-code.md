## Dress code

Make sure to be dressed for the seasons. It might not feel cold for a short
walk, but it is something quite different when you are standing still for hours.
If you are in doubt, rather bring more clothes than less. It is easier to take
off clothes than put on clothes you didn't bring.  

It is also a good idea to consider how your clothes affect your audience. In a
perfect world, nobody would care how anyone dressed, but in reality people are
judgmental about it.  

To be more effective, consider wearing clothes that matches who you think you
will be giving out fliers to. Research shows that people are more positive
towards others that look like them, and they will therefore be more likely to
accept a flier from you if you look alike. If you are leafleting in a city
square, it may be a good idea to take off the piercings, radical clothing and
provocative political messages. On the other hand, if you are leafleting at a
punk concert, this kind of dress code is probably a good idea. Consider your
audience and try as far as possible to fit in when you are leafleting.
