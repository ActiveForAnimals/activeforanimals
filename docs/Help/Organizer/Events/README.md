On the Active for Animals website, event pages contain basic information about
an event, such as start and end dates and times, address, a description and
event title.  
As organizer you would typically create an event page for each event you
organize. After the event has concluded, you can then add results to the event.  
Event pages can have any available result type added to it, be it a leafleting
result, signatures or something else.

Each event created on the Active for Animals website contributes to the
statistical insight into your organizations outreach performance. This will
allow the organization to maximize the available resources and help as many
animals as possible, by doing the outreach that is most effective.  
When you create an event, you are contributing to this goal.
