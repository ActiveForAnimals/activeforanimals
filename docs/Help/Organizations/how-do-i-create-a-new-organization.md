## How do I create a new organization?

The quickest way is to follow this link: [create an organization](/o/add) and
follow the instructions (you need to be logged in to continue).

Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the organization overview page.
1. In the bottom of the *Organization* overview, click on *Create organization*.
1. Fill out the required fields in the form and click *Save*.

  alt="Click on 'Create a new organization'."/>

When you create an organization, a default group and a collection of default
result types will be automatically added. This will help you to get started
quicker.
