Track your fundraising data, more informative responses from the website and
support for feedback!

### Feature spotlight: Track your income and spending

Income and expenses are essential parts to any campaign. Now you can track your
income when raising funds, or add expense data to your leafleting results, to
keep track of where your campaign budget is spent on a by-event basis.

To get started is easy: Go to your organization page and click on "Manage
results". From here, simply add the income or expense data to your existing
result types or create a completely new result type such as "Fundraising".

### Other features in this release

- More informative and prettier system responses when visiting restricted or
non-existent pages.
- A first release of website feedback, supporting a simple rating and message.
Feedback link for logged-in users can be found in the contact section of the
footer. Expect more feedback integration in future releases.
