The amount of fliers to bring depend on place and time, and how many leafleters are with you. In larger cities, try out 60-70 fliers per person for every hour you hand out. In smaller cities, you should probably bring enough for 40-50 fliers per person per hour. By these numbers it is assumed that you place yourself somewhere with a lot of people at a good time of day.

People rarely get angry at you for leafleting. If you are friendly and smiling, very few people are provoked by being offered a flier. Should it happen, it is important to stay positive. It is quite alright to inform them that you don't want to discuss with them and wish them a good day. Usually people will be surprised if their rudeness is met with politeness, and that usually hampers their aggression. It is also important to be polite in order not to become negative yourself. You are far more effective when you are happy and smiling, and if you reply to rudeness with politeness it is far easier to remain in a good mood. If you engage in negative discussions, nobody wins. The chance of convincing an angry person is very small, and negative discussions rarely help the mood.

Sometimes people ask us questions that we can't answer. There is no shame in being unable to answer. Admit that you can't answer the question, and perhaps ask them for their e-mail address so you can check and write them back. Usually it will be enough however to ask people to read the flier. Remember that we try to avoid talking too much with people when leafleting. You can always tell people that you are too busy handing out fliers. Tell them that the flier contains the information necessary, and that their question probably will be answered by reading it.

It is completely normal to be intimidated by leafleting in the beginning. The first time on the street will almost always be a little awkward. It is important to note that this feeling goes away when you have been on the street a couple of times. It's all about getting used to it, and not letting yourself be scared of trying. You quickly learn that a friendly and smiling demeanor will make every leafleting event a positive experience for you. People usually smiles back, and most are friendly.

## <a name="do-you-give-fliers-to-children"></a>Do you give fliers to children?

Generally you shouldn't give children a flier. Childen are usually not old enough to understand the information, and parents can become angry if you give fliers with violent and bloody images to their children. One issue is that children often ask their parents for a flier, and if the child reaches out after one, you should ask the parents permission to give it to their child. Teenagers and children older than 12 years should always be given a flier. They are within our primary target group and they are old enough to understand the information and make up their own mind.

Your own country laws will apply to leafleting events. Usually, in European countries, you can hand out fliers without a permit, as long as you are standing in public places and there are just a few of you. If you are standing on private property and are asked to leave, you should always comply. If you are standing on public property and are asked to leave, comply as far as the laws of your country require you. If an officer instructs you, always comply to their instructions. Be respectful and polite to police officers. It is better for our cause to keep a friendly and respectful tone towards officers, and doing so will also make them behave better towards us.
