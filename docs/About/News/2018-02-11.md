Group access for organizers, event templates in exports and more...

### Organizers can edit their group page
With this new feature, organizers can now maintain their own group page. This
allows your organizers to keep their group page up to date and relevant, and
can help distribute the workload of managing groups. Some group options are
still restricted to managers, such as available result types and staff access.
 
### Event templates are now exportable
When creating events from an event template, the name of the template will be
available when exporting the event. This gives you additional ways to categorize
your events and can give insight into what kind of events you have held
throughout the year.

### Other features in this release

- You can hide event creation and/or template creation links. Go to your
organization page, click 'Edit this page' and select an option under 'Event
creation' to hide/show links.
- Bugfix: Organizer access to export properly restricted.
- Bugfix: Having empty dates in events had some issues . This is now fixed.
- Bugfix: The experimental charts now correctly display results.
