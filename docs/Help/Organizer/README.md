## What is an organizer?

An organizer is the person organizing and arranging events for a group. The
organizer arranges events, invites people and generally takes care of all the
practicalities of street activities.  

On activeforanimals.com, many of these tasks are assisted to help the organizer
as much as possible.

## How do I become an organizer?

You will need to ask a manager of your organization to add you to your group as
organizer. When you become an organizer, you will receive a notification by
e-mail or text message informing you of your new role.
