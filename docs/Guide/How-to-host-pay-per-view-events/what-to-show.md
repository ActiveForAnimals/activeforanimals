## What to show

It is likely that your organization has a library of animal rights movies to
show at pay-per-view events. Generally, pay-per-view movies are about the animal
farming industry, but your message may vary. Remember that people are usually
too busy to watch through a long movie. A short movie a couple of minutes long
is best suited to the pay-per-view format. To see an example, click here to
