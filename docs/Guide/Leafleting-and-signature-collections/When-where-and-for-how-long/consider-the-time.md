## Consider the time

When leafleting, some time periods of the day are better than others. It's all
about meeting as many people as possible. On work days, the best time is when
people are going to work or when they are off work, typically between 7 to 10
and 15 to 18.    
You can also use the hours around lunch time to target people that are going out
for food. In the weekend, saturday morning between 9 and 12 is typically a good
time. On sunday stores may be closed, so it may be better to focus on parks or
other places of social gatherings. Assuming of crouse, that the weather is
acceptable.
