## How many fliers should I bring?

The amount of fliers to bring depend on place and time, and how many leafleters
are with you. In larger cities, try out 60-70 fliers per person for every hour
you hand out. In smaller cities, you should probably bring enough for 40-50
fliers per person per hour. By these numbers it is assumed that you place
yourself somewhere with a lot of people at a good time of day.
